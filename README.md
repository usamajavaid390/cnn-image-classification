# cnn-image-classification
This project demonstrates image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras. It leverages the CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, making it suitable for training and evaluating image classification models.
