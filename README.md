# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Introduction

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, where the goal is to categorize images into predefined classes or categories. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be highly effective for image classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various datasets.

This project demonstrates image classification using CNNs with TensorFlow and Keras. It utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, making it suitable for training and evaluating image classification models.

By implementing and training a CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, this project showcases the process of building a machine learning model for image classification. It covers data preprocessing, model construction, training, evaluation, and performance analysis, providing insights into the effectiveness of CNNs for image classification tasks.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
